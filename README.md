# Heyo! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Don MacKinnon

## Co-Founder & CTO at [Searchcraft](https://searchcraft.io)

When people ask me what I do, I tell them I'm a builder.  I've been writing software professionally since 1998. I co-founded Searchcraft in 2024 which is a developer tool for search and information discovery.  I'm passionate about building software in the Rust language these days but the list of languages and frameworks I've used over the years is long.

Prior to co-founding a developer tool startup I spent over a decade as a consultant building applications for both startups and enterprise organizations in a wide variety of industries. Before that I spent over a decade on the technical side of the publishing industry building mobile applications, doing large data migrations, building CMS platforms and of course, building out search experiences.
