# Heyo! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Don MacKinnon

## Co-Founder & CTO at [Searchcraft](https://searchcraft.io)

When people ask me what I do, I tell them I'm a builder.  I've been writing software professionally since 1998. I co-founded Searchcraft in 2024 which is a developer tool for search and information discovery.  I'm passionate about building software in the Rust language these days but the list of languages and frameworks I've used over the years is long.

* I'm based in the Denver metro area of Colorado.
